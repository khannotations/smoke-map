# Motivation

The frequency and intensity of wildfires are estimated to increase in the coming decades.

Wildfires can dramatically increase the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air, which can potentially impose health concerns in exposed populations.
The Western US is one of the regions around the world that are prone to wildfires.

Knowing the future exposure to PM2.5 specifically from wildfires can raise the awareness of the potential harm from the air pollution from wildfires, and aid community preparedness to reduce the public health burden from wildfire smoke.

Our prior work created a term called "smoke wave" to describe high PM2.5 episodes from wildfire smoke.

We developed an index, Fire Smoke Risk Index (FSRI) to demonstrate the overall risk to smoke waves.

In addition to FSRI, we studied the following smoke wave characteristics:

 - Total number of smoke waves
 - Total number of smoke wave days (days categorized as smoke wave days)
 - Average smoke wave length (mean number of days during a smoke wave)
 - Average smoke wave intensity (mean daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 level during a smoke wave).

# Information from the map

This map showed the following information about smoke wave risks in Western US counties at the present-day (2004-2009) and in the future (2046-2051)

1. Present-day, county-level information on FSRI, total number of smoke waves, total number of smoke wave days, average smoke wave length, and average smoke wave intensity.
2. Future, county-level information on FSRI, total number of smoke waves, total number of smoke wave days, average smoke wave length, and average smoke wave intensity.
3. County-level all-age population and population density estimates in 2005 or 2050.
4. Rankings on each smoke wave characteristics for counties in each state. Can rank by the value at present day, the value in the future, county fips, or the difference between present-day values and future values.

# Use of map

To generate information #1:

1. Choose your smoke wave characteristic of interest from the drop-down menu called "Choose SW info"
2. Choose time frame = Present
3. Choose Scale by = County

To generate information #2:

1. Choose your smoke wave characteristic of interest from the drop-down menu called "Choose SW info"
2. Choose time frame = Future
3. Choose Scale by = County

To generate information #3:

1. Choose your smoke wave characteristic of interest from the drop-down menu called "Choose SW info"
2. Choose time frame of interest
3. Choose Scale by = County
4. Choose population = #Ppl (population size), or Ppl/mi2 (population density)

To generate information #4:

1. Choose time frame of interest
2. Choose Scale by = State
3. Click on a state of interest
4. Under "Data View" panel, choose the smoke wave characteristics of interest in the drop down menu called "Choose SW info" within the panel
5. Choose sorting option: by future-present difference, present-day value, future value, or county fips.
6. In the bar chart of rankings that shows up, hover the mouse onto the county of interest in the bar chart to see where it is on the map.
